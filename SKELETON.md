# Compiler 2 Source Skeleton

This document is the implementation skeleton for Compiler 2. It assigns every
design responsibility to a checked-in manifest, assembly module, host tool,
generated artifact, and test layer. It is not itself an implementation: a row
in a routine table is an obligation, not evidence that the behavior exists.

**Authority:** `REQUIREMENTS.md` / `REU_REQUIREMENTS.md`, then `DESIGN2.md` /
`REU_DESIGN.md`, then focused `docs/`. This skeleton must not invent architecture
or reintroduce a geoRAM-only product model. Generated manifests are the source
of truth for concrete addresses, IDs, ABI records, and sizes; prose here must
not duplicate generated values as if they were current output.

## 0. Validation Status

### 0.1 Design-audit demotions (2026-07-09) and re-implementation (2026-07-15)

After the dual-device / QUIT / SAVE-token / COMPILE-layout design lock, production
code was audited against `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `DESIGN2.md`. Modules that
claimed completeness under an older model were **reverted to SKELETON**, then
re-implemented on 2026-07-15 for Phases 2–6 (non-VICE). Later-phase items remain
open.

| Design delta | Production state (2026-07-15) |
|---|---|
| Dual geoRAM+REU store/XIP/assist | **Done** — geoRAM + REU non-destructive detect; dual probe prefers geoRAM; `reu_xip_active` flag (default 0) |
| QUIT soft-reset | **Done** — `quit_to_stock` via `direct_execute_command` / degraded editor |
| NMI RESTORE distrust | **Done** — `nmi_entry`, `compiler_vectors` install + prior save/restore |
| SAVE by tokens / VERIFY = SAVE bytes | **Done** — token-class `program_select_save_format`; language `rio_save`/`rio_verify` |
| COMPILE soft 80/100 + dual `$CE00` layout | **Done** — `export_compile_command` / `export_check_budgets` |
| 512 KiB hard build fail | **Done** — `validate_georam_image_budget` hard-fails from size report |
| FRE profile-aware / narrow POKE | **Done** — `fre_*` + `system_poke` with conditional `$CE00` |
| Minimal editor (error+QUIT) | **Done** — `resident_enter_degraded` |
| Loader dual install / fingerprint skip-reload | **Done** — `loader_entry` dual path; unit + integration coverage |
| Compressor / CGS1 decompress | **Done** — `compressor.asm` + stream reader; system/unit coverage |
| VICE E2E/hardware acceptance | **Deferred** — Phase 11 `[!]` until live VICE suite is in scope |

Do not mark owning `TASKS.md` items `[x]` until re-implemented through the
production path and acceptance tests.

### 0.2 Structural ownership map

| Design responsibility | Owning implementation |
|---|---|
| Stock/extended tokenized file formats and transactional replacement | `geoasm/program_codec.asm`, `geoasm/program_store.asm`, `manifests/program_formats.json` |
| Eight replayable compiler boundaries and atomic source/code publication | `geoasm/compiler_pipeline.asm`, `geoasm/incremental.asm` |
| Direct/program classification and one immediate/program compiler path | `geoasm/direct_dispatch.asm`, generated command table |
| Source-free `COMPILE` export and its restricted shell | `geoasm/compile_export.asm`, `runtime/inspection.asm`, standalone linker profile |
| DOS wedge before BASIC tokenization | `geoasm/dos_wedge.asm`, `runtime/wedge.asm`, resident input dispatch |
| Graphics ownership and one exit path | `runtime/graphics.asm`, generated memory policy |
| Dual-device expansion profile and fatal integrity handling | `arena/georam_detect.asm`, `arena/reu_detect.asm`, `resident/expansion_profile.asm`, `resident/georam_gate.asm`, `arena/overlay_dispatch.asm` (geoRAM XIP), `resident/fatal.asm`; full REU-native dual dispatcher / XIP miss path remains REU-phase work (`reu_xip_active` exists, default 0) |
| Generated ABI, arena, ZP, placement, test-entry, and traceability contracts | structured manifests and `tools/` generators |
| Current-build API and memory-map references | `tools/generate_reference.py`, `build/API.md`, `build/MAP.md` |

geoRAM capacity: minimum 512 KiB = 32 hardware 16 KiB blocks = 2,048
256-byte pages (`docs/GEORAM_BANKING.md`). REU minimum is also 512 KiB of
non-aliased DMA memory (`REU_REQUIREMENTS.md`).

The routine tables below are a coverage inventory. Before an assembly entry is
implemented, its machine ABI must be expressible without placeholders such as
"target-dependent", "on stack", or two simultaneous meanings for the same
register. `manifests/routines.json` owns those exact contracts and the build
rejects an implemented public/test entry whose contract is incomplete.

## 2. Standard Calling Convention

All public 6502 subroutines in Compiler 2 follow this convention unless
documented otherwise in the per-routine table.

### 2.1 Register Protocol

| Register | Usage |
|---|---|
| A | Primary 8-bit input and output; also used for 16-bit lo byte |
| X | Secondary 8-bit input / 16-bit hi byte; also used for array dims |
| Y | Tertiary input / 16-bit offset; loop index for block copies |
| C (carry) | Standard success/failure flag where the routine can fail |
| Z (zero) | Result only when the routine contract explicitly declares it |
| V (overflow) | Result only for a declared signed comparison/arithmetic ABI |
| N (negative) | Result only for a declared comparison/sign-test ABI |
| D (decimal) | Always clear at every public entry and exit boundary |

Flags not named as outputs are clobbered. A routine may document another carry
meaning (for example loop-complete), but then it is not also an error flag;
errors must use a separately declared path. Exact preservation and result
flags come from `manifests/routines.json`.

### 2.2 Static Output String ABI

Every compile-time string whose purpose is direct output uses one packed
representation: bytes are stored in output order and bit 7 is set on the final
character. The final byte is still a character; the shared emitter masks bit 7
before writing it. Empty static output strings are forbidden. Static output
strings must not use NUL termination or a stored length, and modules must not
carry private terminator-scanning print loops. Dynamic BASIC string values and
non-output byte records retain their own descriptor formats.

`kernal_print_packed` is the sole static-message emitter. Tests must verify the
packed bytes, final-character marker, emitted characters, and rejection by
build validation of NUL-terminated or length-prefixed static output literals.

### 2.3 Stack Discipline

- Every normally returning public subroutine restores SP to its entry value
  before `RTS`.
- `JSR` pushes a 2-byte return address; internal `JSR` calls are balanced
  by `RTS` within the same routine.
- Tail transfers, fatal/error unwinds, program entry, and non-returning editor
  loops declare a non-`return` return kind and a tested destination stack
  invariant instead.
- `RTI` is reserved for IRQ/NMI paths. `BRK` is permitted only in an explicit
  debug-trap build and is never a production control-flow mechanism.
- Subroutines that call KERNAL routines do so through `kernal_bridge` which
  handles serialization, interrupt-state save/restore, and `$01` banking.
  The pinned IRQ is the sole exception and directly invokes only its approved
  `UDTIM`/`SCNKEY` calls in the fixed IRQ sequence.

### 2.4 Zero-Page Clobber Contract

Every subroutine declares which ZP bytes it writes (clobbers). A routine that
reads ZP bytes not listed as inputs or clobbers is a bug. The graph-coloring
allocator uses these clobber lists to build the interference graph.

ZP reads and writes are listed per routine in the tables below using symbols
imported through `src/common/zp.inc` from `build/zp_symbols.inc`.

### 2.5 Branch Conventions

- The 6502 has a 16-bit address space; there is no 24-bit branch form.
- Relative and absolute control flow is permitted within one linked 256-byte
  geoRAM routine page when the placement validator proves the instruction and
  target both remain in `$DE00-$DEFF`.
- Every cross-page call or jump uses a generated resident gate entry. No raw
  branch, `JSR`, or `JMP` may cross a page-selection boundary.

### 2.6 GeoRAM Routine Constraints

- Each routine fits entirely within one selected geoRAM page.
- Entry is only at a generated offset within that page.
- Routine must not fall through `$DEFF` (end of 256-byte geoRAM window).
- Tail transfers use `context_stack` push/pop, not raw `JSR`-return
  manipulation.
- The geoRAM gate (`georam_gate.asm`) is the sole normal entry into geoRAM
  from resident code. Group-specific entries consume an 8-bit routine index,
  resolve generated page/block/offset metadata, save the declared caller
  state, call the target, capture declared results, and restore state before
  returning.

## 3. CPU Memory Map

```
$0000-$0001  6510 CPU port registers (always live, never allocated)
$0002-$00FF  Zero page — graph-coloring allocated (see §5)
$0100-$01FF  CPU hardware stack
$0200-$CFFF  Normal RAM pool — generated, non-overlapping resident/runtime,
             no-load workspace, compiled-code, and dynamic-data extents
$D000-$DFFF  I/O: VIC-II, SID, CIA, geoRAM window ($DE00-$DEFF),
             geoRAM registers ($DFFE, $DFFF), color RAM ($D800-$DBFF)
$E000-$FFF8  Normal RAM pool when graphics is inactive; KERNAL ROM overlays
             this range only while a KERNAL bridge selects $01=$36
$FFF9        Project guard byte ($A9 or build-defined sentinel)
$FFFA-$FFFB  NMI vector (RAM, managed by loader)
$FFFC-$FFFD  RESET vector (RAM, managed by loader)
$FFFE-$FFFF  IRQ/BRK vector (RAM, points to pinned resident irq entry)
```

The checked-in linker policy and generated allocation report define the exact
partition inside the two normal-RAM pools. This document deliberately does not
invent fixed resident/runtime ranges. File-backed segments, `COMPILER_BSS`,
compiled code, runtime workspace, and dynamic arenas must be disjoint in each
build profile, and the post-link validator proves the partition against the
map and manifests.

### 3.1 Graphics Mode Overlay

When bitmap mode is active (VIC bank 3, `$D018=$78`):
- `$E000-$FF3F` is bitmap pixels — not available for general RAM.
- `$DC00-$DFE7` holds the screen/color matrix (1000 bytes) — accessible
  only through the RAM-under-I/O gate.
- `$D800-$DBE7` is physical VIC-II color RAM.
- Dynamic RAM ceiling drops to `$DBFF`.
- Graphics mode is left (text mode restored) on END, error, STOP, and
  STOP-key interruption.

### 3.2 Standalone COMPILE Budget

- PRG load address: `$0801`
- Loader stub `2026 SYS2061` occupies `$0801-$080C`
- Compiled payload range: `$080D-$CFFF` (51,187 bytes maximum)
- Budget = user code + runtime helpers + relocation metadata +
  variable descriptors + inspection shell
- Tokenized source is NOT counted against this budget.
- Runtime variables, arrays, strings, control frames, and shell workspace are
  separately allocated from legal stock-C64 RAM not occupied by the loaded
  image. The export linker profile proves that image and workspace do not
  overlap.

### 3.3 geoRAM Window

- Data/code window: `$DE00-$DEFF` (256 bytes, selected geoRAM page)
- Page register: `$DFFE` (0..63, selects page within 16 KiB block)
- Block register: `$DFFF` (0..N, selects 16 KiB block)
- Logical page = block × 64 + page
- Only `georam_gate` and approved diagnostics write `$DFFE`/`$DFFF`

---

## 4. Linker Segment Policy

The checked-in policy owns invariant reservations and segment classes. The
generated configuration assigns concrete, non-overlapping extents:

| Segment class | Placement rule | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BASIC_STUB` | packaged at `$0801-$080C`, entry `$080D` | exact `2026 SYS2061` linked-line stub |
| `INSTALL_LOADER` | generated development-profile staging extent from `$080D` | detector, payload installer/decompressor, `GEORAM` loader |
| `STANDALONE_IMAGE` | export profile within `$080D-$CFFF` | source-free compiled code/runtime/shell image |
| `RESIDENT` | pinned below `$D000` in generated normal-RAM extent | IRQ/NMI reachable while KERNAL ROM is visible, screen front end, gates, fatal path |
| `RUNTIME` | generated normal-RAM extent | stable compiled-program ABI |
| `COMPILER_BSS` | generated `NOLOAD` extent | cleared post-install workspace |
| `COMPILED_CODE` | generated dynamic extent | current compiled image; never overlaps runtime/data |
| `DYNAMIC_DATA` | one or more explicit free extents | variables, arrays, strings, frames, editor buffer |
| `GEOCODE_*` | one segment per generated geoRAM page | compiler/editor/math native routines |
| `GEODATA_*` | generated geoRAM pages | directories, arenas, read-only data |
| `BITMAP` | `$E000-$FF3F` when graphics profile is active | bitmap pixels |
| `BITMAP_MATRIX` | `$DC00-$DFE7` under I/O | bitmap screen matrix |
| `GUARD` | `$FFF9` | project sentinel |
| `VECTORS` | `$FFFA-$FFFF` | NMI/RESET/IRQ-BRK vectors |

`DYNAMIC_DATA` is allocator-owned free space, not an `ld65` segment laid over
`RESIDENT`, `RUNTIME`, or `COMPILED_CODE`. Text and graphics profiles have
different generated free-extent lists; entering graphics transactionally
removes `$DC00-$FF3F`, and exit restores it only after graphics state is
invalidated. `tools/linker_config.py` adds the current geoRAM inventory and
the development/standalone profile-specific segments.

---

## 5. Zero-Page Allocation Manifest

Every project allocation below is a node in the graph-coloring interference
model. Addresses are generated by `tools/zp_alloc.py` and written to
`build/zp_symbols.inc`. Stock KERNAL/IRQ workspace is different:
its addresses are architectural constraints imported from `c64rom`, not
colors the project may move. The generated graph reserves those fixed ranges
and overlays project storage only when its lifetime is proven disjoint.

### 5.1 Lifetime Domains

| Domain | Description | IRQ-safe |
|---|---|---|
| `cpu_port` | `$00-$01` — always live, never allocated | yes |
| `irq_state` | Concurrently live with foreground (keyboard, timer) | yes |
| `georam_gate` | geoRAM call gate, context stack, selected state | no |
| `kernal_bridge` | KERNAL bridge call-scoped ZP effects | no |
| `runtime_abi` | Compiled runtime ABI call pointers | no |
| `expression` | Expression evaluator temporaries | no |
| `math_fac` | Numeric FAC/ARG/extended math | no |
| `stmt_scratch` | Statement-local scratch | no |
| `tokenizer` | Tokenizer/lexer state | no |
| `parser` | Parser/compiler phase temporaries | no |
| `editor` | Editor foreground state (screen, cursor) | no |
| `loader` | Loader/install-only (overlaid post-install) | no |
| `error_unwind` | Error unwind state | no |
| `stop_cont` | STOP/CONT resumable state | no |

### 5.2 Fixed Architectural Reservations

| Symbol | Fixed range | Domain | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `zp_cpu_port` | `$00-$01` | `cpu_port` | 6510 DDR and data |
| `zp_stkey` | `$91` | `irq_state` | STOP key flag, `UDTIM`/`STOP` |
| `zp_time` | `$A0-$A2` | `irq_state` | Jiffy clock, `UDTIM`/`RDTIM`/`SETTIM` |
| `zp_lstx` | `$C5` | `irq_state` | Current key from matrix |
| `zp_ndx` | `$C6` | `irq_state` | Keyboard buffer count |
| `zp_sfdx` | `$CB` | `irq_state` | Keyboard shift state |
| `zp_keytab` | `$F5-$F6` | `irq_state` | Keyboard decode-table pointer |

### 5.3 KERNAL Bridge ZP Set

These fixed locations seed broader generated call-domain sets. The table is a
minimum address map, not a complete clobber contract; device-specific paths
are derived from the labeled `c64rom` call graph and can reserve additional
workspace.

| Symbol | Fixed range | KERNAL use |
|---|---:|---|
| `zp_status` | `$90` | I/O status (`READST` and device paths) |
| `zp_ldtnd` | `$98` | open-file table count/index |
| `zp_dfltn` | `$99` | default input device/channel paths |
| `zp_dflto` | `$9A` | default output device/channel paths |
| `zp_sal` / `zp_sah` | `$AC-$AD` | save/load start address workspace |
| `zp_eal` / `zp_eah` | `$AE-$AF` | save/load end address workspace |
| `zp_fnlen` | `$B7` | filename length |
| `zp_la` | `$B8` | logical file number |
| `zp_sa` | `$B9` | secondary address |
| `zp_fa` | `$BA` | device; persistent current-disk state |
| `zp_fnadr` | `$BB-$BC` | filename pointer |
| `zp_pntr` | `$D3` | screen cursor column on applicable paths |

`zp_fa` remains live between direct commands and therefore cannot overlay
project scratch merely because no KERNAL call is currently active.

| `zp_crsr_vis` | 1 | `editor` | Cursor visible flag |
| `zp_linebuf` | 2 | `editor` | Pointer to resident line capture buffer |
| `zp_line_len` | 1 | `editor` | Current line length in buffer |

### 5.10 STOP/CONT Resumable State ZP

| Symbol | Size | Domain | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `zp_cont_handle` | 2 | `stop_cont` | Handle of persistent continuation descriptor |
| `zp_cont_generation` | 2 | `stop_cont` | Runtime/source generation checked by CONT |
| `zp_stop_flag` | 1 | `stop_cont` | STOP/STOP-key validity and reason bits |

The continuation descriptor owns the resumable PC plus the saved runtime
control/stack state required by the generated code. A raw hardware SP value is
not a sufficient continuation and is never the whole persisted state.

### 5.11 Error Unwind ZP

| Symbol | Size | Domain | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `zp_errnum` | 1 | `error_unwind` | Current BASIC error number |
| `zp_errline` | 2 | `error_unwind` | Source line of error |
| `zp_errptr` | 2 | `error_unwind` | Pointer into source for error context |

### 5.12 Loader-Only ZP (overlaid post-install)

These overlap with post-install domains since the loader runs once and
does not coexist with editor/compiler/runtime.

| Symbol | Size | Domain | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `zp_ldr_src` | 2 | `loader` | Source pointer during payload copy |
| `zp_ldr_dst` | 2 | `loader` | Destination pointer during payload copy |
| `zp_ldr_len` | 2 | `loader` | Block length during payload copy |
| `zp_ldr_blk` | 1 | `loader` | geoRAM block counter during load |
| `zp_ldr_pge` | 1 | `loader` | geoRAM page counter during load |
| `zp_georam_stream` | 15 | `loader` | CGS1 stream reader decompressor state |

### 5.13 Graph-Coloring Solver Input

The `tools/zp_alloc.py` solver consumes a JSON manifest with these fields
per node:

```json
{
  "name": "zp_fac1",
  "size": 5,
  "alignment": 1,
  "domain": "math_fac",
  "lifetimes": ["runtime_abi", "math_fac"],
  "aliases_allowed": [],
  "interference_overrides": [],
  "notes": "Stock FAC1 layout, 5 bytes at contiguous addresses"
}
```

Interference edges are auto-generated when:
- Two nodes have overlapping lifetime domains
- One node is live across a call that clobbers the other
- One is `irq_state` and the other is not IRQ-safe
- A KERNAL bridge call scope includes the node's domain
- An explicit `interference_overrides` entry lists a conflicting node

Solver output format:

```json
{
  "addresses": {"zp_fac1": {"addr": "$64", "size": 5}, ...},
  "interference_edges": [{"a": "zp_fac1", "b": "zp_tmp1", "reason": "domain:math_fac overlaps stmt_scratch"}],
  "peak_live_bytes": {"math_fac": 16, "expression": 8, "parser": 7, ...},
  "unused_bytes": ["$C0-$C4", ...]
}
```

## 6. Routine Tables

Every exported public routine is declared in `manifests/routines.json`;
`tools/generate_contracts.py` emits the production and test-build entry
manifests. Internal helpers become callable only in a test build through an
explicit test-only manifest entry; this never enlarges the production ABI.

Legend:
- **In** — logical inputs; a multi-field input is passed by one typed record
  handle unless explicit registers are shown
- **Out** — logical outputs; exact returned registers/flags are generated from
  `manifests/routines.json`
- **Clob** — registers and ZP bytes modified (never restored)
- **Side** — observable side effects beyond register/ZP changes
- **ZP** — zero-page symbols read (R) or written (W) by this routine

`c64rom/basic/lexing/token_strings.s`; extensions use a separately versioned
range and never renumber stock errors.

### 6.2 `src/common/macros.asm`

No subroutines. Exports assemble-time macros.

| Macro | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `assert_canonical` | Debug: assert `$01=$35` at entry/exit |
| `assert_irq_disabled` | Debug: assert I flag set (IRQ masked) |
| `debug_trap` | `BRK` with facility ID for diagnostics |
| `zp_clobber_check` | Debug: poison non-live ZP, verify caller's clobber list |
| `page_check` | Debug: verify geoRAM page boundary not crossed |
| `stack_balance` | Debug: verify SP restored after call |

---

### 6.3 `src/resident/irq.asm`

Pinned resident IRQ handler. It does not enter the serialized foreground
bridge. It saves the interrupted CPU-port value, selects KERNAL+I/O, directly
calls only `UDTIM` and `SCNKEY` in the approved order, performs bounded cursor
service, acknowledges CIA state, and restores the exact interrupted mapping
and registers.

| Routine | In | Out | Clob | Side | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `irq_entry` | hardware IRQ frame (CPU has pushed PC/P; A/X/Y are live) | interrupted A/X/Y/P/PC and mapping restored | internal IRQ save set | Advances jiffy clock, updates keyboard state, blinks cursor | Pinned entry: save A/X/Y/mapping, UDTIM, cursor, SCNKEY, CIA ack, restore, RTI |
| `irq_update_jiffy` | IRQ-private call | — | A X Y, declared flags | Calls KERNAL `UDTIM` directly while IRQ entry owns `$01=$36` | Called only from `irq_entry` |
| `irq_cursor_blink` | — | — | A X Y | Reverse-videos the screen cell at `zp_crsr_x`/`zp_crsr_y` when `zp_crsr_vis` is set | Bounded resident cursor service; no geoRAM dependency |
| `irq_scan_keyboard` | IRQ-private call | — | A X Y, declared flags | Calls KERNAL `SCNKEY` directly after cursor service | Called only from `irq_entry` |
| `irq_restore_mapping` | saved interrupted `$01`/P | exact interrupted mapping/P restored | A | Does not touch geoRAM selection | Called before `RTI` |

---

### 6.4 `src/resident/screen.asm`

Bounded screen/cursor management. Resident half only — heavy editor
services (tokenize, list) go through `editor_svc` in geoRAM.

| Routine | In | Out | Clob | Side | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `screen_init` | — | — | A X Y | Initializes screen editor state, clears screen | Cold-start screen setup |
| `screen_clear` | — | — | A X Y | Clears screen, homes cursor | CLR/HOME |
| `screen_scroll_up` | — | — | A X Y | Scrolls screen memory up one line | When cursor below bottom |
| `screen_putchar` | A=char | — | A | Writes character at cursor, advances cursor | Resident output primitive |
| `screen_getchar` | — | A=char or $00 | A X | Reads character at cursor position | For LIST display |
| `screen_cursor_on` | — | — | A | Sets cursor visible flag | |
| `screen_cursor_off` | — | — | A | Clears cursor visible flag | |
| `screen_cursor_right` | — | — | A | Advances cursor column, wraps to next line | |
| `screen_cursor_left` | — | — | A | Retreats cursor column, wraps to prev line | |
| `screen_cursor_down` | — | — | A | Advances cursor row, scrolls if needed | |
| `screen_cursor_up` | — | — | A | Retreats cursor row | |
| `screen_line_input` | `zp_linebuf`=buffer ptr | `zp_line_len`=length | A X Y | Captures one logical line from screen into buffer | Bounded line capture for editor; respects quote mode |

---

### 6.5 `src/resident/kernal_bridge.asm`

Bank-safe wrapper for every foreground KERNAL ROM call. It serializes KERNAL
workspace use, installs/validates the pinned RAM-indirect IRQ vector, selects
`$01=$36`, and restores `$35` plus the incoming interrupt state. Short,
proven-bounded calls may keep IRQ masked for their complete mapping window.
Blocking file/channel calls must re-enable the incoming IRQ state while ROM is
visible; masking interrupts for an entire blocking call is forbidden.

| Routine | In | Out | Clob | Side | ZP (W) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `kernal_readst` | — | A=status | A | Reads KERNAL status | `zp_status` | READST bridge |
| `kernal_setlfs` | A=lf, X=dev, Y=sa | — | A X Y | Sets logical/device/secondary parameters; does not open | `zp_la`, `zp_sa`, `zp_fa` | SETLFS bridge |
| `kernal_setnam` | A=len, X/Y=name | — | A X Y | Sets filename for next OPEN/LOAD/SAVE | `zp_fnlen`, `zp_fnadr` | SETNAM bridge |

| `kernal_chkout` | X=lf | C=error | A X Y | Sets output channel | `zp_status`, channel workspace | CHKOUT bridge |
| `kernal_clrchn` | — | — | A X Y | Restores default channels | `zp_c3po`, `zp_d7`, channel workspace | CLRCHN bridge |
| `kernal_chrin` | — | A=byte | A X Y | Reads byte from input channel | `zp_pntr`, channel workspace | CHRIN bridge |
| `kernal_chrout` | A=byte | C=error | A X Y | Writes byte to output channel | generated channel workspace | CHROUT bridge |
| `kernal_print_packed` | X/Y=packed static string | C=0 | A X Y | Masks and emits bytes through the bit-7 final-character marker | `zp_src`, generated channel workspace | Sole static-output-string emitter |
| `kernal_load` | A=mode, X/Y=addr | C=error, X/Y=ended addr | A X Y | Loads from device | `zp_status`, `zp_fa`, `zp_eal` | LOAD bridge |
| `kernal_save` | A=ZP-ptr, X/Y=end | C=error | A X Y | Saves to device | `zp_fa`, `zp_sal`, `zp_eal` | SAVE bridge |
| `kernal_settim` | A=lo, X=mid, Y=hi | — | A X Y | Sets jiffy clock | `zp_time` | SETTIM bridge |
| `kernal_rdtim` | — | A=lo, X=mid, Y=hi | A X Y | Reads jiffy clock | `zp_time` | RDTIM bridge |
| `kernal_stop` | — | Z=1 if STOP pressed | A | Checks STOP key | `zp_stkey`, `zp_ndx` | STOP bridge |
| `kernal_getin` | — | A=byte or $00 | A X Y | Reads from keyboard buffer | `zp_ndx`, `zp_status` | GETIN bridge |
| `kernal_udtim` | — | — | A X Y | Advances jiffy clock one tick | `zp_time`, `zp_stkey` | UDTIM bridge |
| `kernal_scnkey` | — | — | A X Y | Scans keyboard matrix | `zp_lstx`, `zp_ndx`, `zp_sfdx`, `zp_keytab` | SCNKEY bridge |

The ZP column above names only recognizable anchors. The generated bridge
contract contains complete read/write/preserve sets (including
device-dependent workspace), CPU-port behavior, IRQ policy, blocking status,
and returned flags derived from `c64rom`; the build rejects a hand-written
subset that disagrees with it.

---

### 6.6 `src/resident/georam_gate.asm`

Sole resident entry into geoRAM-resident code. Maintains a software
mirror of `$DFFE`/`$DFFF`. Uses the context stack for nested calls.

---

### 6.7 `src/resident/ram_under_io.asm`

Gate for accessing RAM at `$D000-$DFFF` (bitmap screen matrix, graphics
memory). Masks IRQ for the full critical section.

| Routine | In | Out | Clob | Side | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### 6.10 `src/geoasm/tokenizer.asm`

Lexical scanner. Resides in geoRAM. Uses a generated
first-character-indexed trie whose accepting nodes carry token ID, dialect

## 8. Generated Artifacts Summary

## 9. Assembly Source Conventions

### 9.1 File Header

Every `.asm` file begins with:

```asm
; <filename>.asm — <purpose>
; Compiler 2 — <layer name>
;
; Public entry: <list of exported labels>
; Internal helpers: <list of non-exported labels>
; Zero-page read:  <list of ZP symbols read>
; Zero-page write: <list of ZP symbols written>
; Clobbers: <registers clobbered by public entries>
```

### 9.2 Include Order

```asm
.include "common/zp.inc"         ; imports build/zp_symbols.inc
.include "common/constants.asm"  ; project-wide equates
.include "common/macros.asm"     ; assemble-time helpers
```

### 9.3 Label Naming

- Public exports: `snake_case` (e.g., `var_resolve`, `kernal_bridge_chrin`)
- Internal helpers: `_snake_case` with leading underscore (e.g., `_push_loop_frame`)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `TYPE_FLOAT`, `ERR_SYNTAX`)
- Generated symbols: prefixed with `zp_` (e.g., `zp_fac1`, `zp_gr_block`)

### 9.4 Debug Sections

Debug-only code is wrapped in:

```asm
.if DEBUG
    ; debug-only checks
.endif
```

### 9.5 GeoRAM Routine Constraints

Each geoRAM routine file must:

1. Use its generated relocatable ca65 segment; source must not hard-code
   placement with `.org`.
2. Export only entries declared in `manifests/routines.json`.
3. Fit every declared routine body and entry in one 256-byte window; the
   linked body and every instruction must remain within `$DE00-$DEFF`.
4. Use the manifest-declared return kind (`RTS`, resident tail transfer, or
   non-returning unwind).
5. Declare which entries it may call (resident runtime helpers or other
   geoRAM routines through the gate).
6. Declare exact inputs, outputs, flags, stack delta, ZP read/write sets,
   arena effects, IRQ policy, and error returns. The generator rejects vague
   or register-conflicting contracts.

## 10. Design Coverage and Completion Gates

This trace is the validation checklist for the skeleton. “Owned” means the
design has an implementation home; it does not mean assembly or tests already
exist.

| Design area | Primary owners | Required proof before complete |
|---|---|---|
| R2/R2.1 product and install slice | loader, resident front end, geoRAM profile, Phase 1 runtime | D64 cold install; absent/undersized rejection; benchmark under 60 jiffies |
| R3 dialect/language surface | generated command/token tables, tokenizer, parser, semantic/runtime handlers | every implemented keyword maps to a handler and E2E case; disabled tokens fail at tokenization |
| R4 direct/program modes | `direct_dispatch.asm`, generated classifier | positive immediate and negative stored/compile cases for every direct-only command |
| R5 program compatibility | `program_codec.asm`, `program_store.asm` | stock V2 canonical load/save byte fixtures; malformed/unknown extension rollback |
| R6 compilation/runtime/export | pipeline, incremental publisher, runtime ABI, export linker | eight replayable boundaries; failure rollback; no dirty RUN; geoRAM-free export dependency proof |
| R7 memory/arenas | linker policy, arena/page allocator, strings, graphics | non-overlap map; generation/owner/bounds faults; separate export code/workspace budgets |
| R8 geoRAM | detector/profile, gate, directory generator, context stack | capacity/alias tests; nested/tail/callback/error-unwind tests; no IRQ selection writes |
| R9 editor/IRQ/wedge | resident loop/IRQ/screen, editor service, wedge | transactional lines; stock editing fixtures; focused VICE IRQ/keyboard/timer/wedge tests |
| R10 KERNAL | generated ROM contracts and bridge | source-audited clobbers; bank/vector/IRQ/blocking-call tests; canonical error cleanup |
| R11 optimization | descriptors, optimizer, codegen, generic runtime loops | differential fast/generic/VICE cases and explicit fallback for every fast path |
| R12 observability | debug macros, dumps/traces/fault injection, validators, generated references | canary, poison, watermark, fault-injection tests; resident size delta; complete `API.md`/`MAP.md` |
| R12.1 build | `build.ps1`, host tools, artifact/reference validators | clean/no-change byte identity; all required artifacts, deterministic references, and system contracts |
| R13 tests | generated entry manifests and pytest hierarchy | direct unit coverage for every callable plus integration/functional/system/E2E layers |
| R14 traceability | trace manifest and matrix generator | no implemented requirement, keyword, test, or stock fixture lacks provenance |
| ZP/IEEE cross-cutting | ZP allocator/ROM domains; IEEE state/math modules | generated interference proof and poison tests; independent IEEE oracle/rounding/flags coverage |

The build must also compare `manifests/routines.json` with linked exports and
these routine tables. A source entry absent from the manifest, a manifest entry
without a linked symbol, an incomplete ABI, or a callable entry without direct
unit metadata is a collection/build failure. That check prevents this document
from drifting into a persuasive but non-executable wish list.
